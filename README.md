### EPPROM-AT24C256
An I2C EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) module, such as those from the AT24C series, is a small memory chip that can be interfaced with a microcontroller or a computer using the I2C protocol. 
### Use Case
These modules are commonly used for storing data such as configuration settings, calibration data, or any other non-volatile data that needs to be preserved even when the power is turned off.
### Specification 
These modules come in a variety of storage capacities, ranging from 1 Kb (kilobit) to 128 Kb or more.
We have used 32KB so The memory address range in the 32 KB EEPROM module will be from 0 to 32,767 (inclusive).And in each bytes you can store vaues from 0 to (2^8)-1 that is 0 to 255.
